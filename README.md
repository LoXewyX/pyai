_Follow these steps before running the program_

- In a terminal $python -m venv env
- If you are in VSCode do this:
- Ctrl + Shift + P and search for: "Python select interpreter"
- You will add a route (path) and you will put ".\env\Scripts\python.exe"
- Ctrl + Ã‘ to open a terminal. If you get "(env) PS X:\\..." you are on the right track
- Now in the same terminal we paste these Python commands:

``` powershell
python.exe -m pip install --update pip\
pip install googletrans==4.0.0rc1\
pip installation requests
```

Now with VSCode's Code Runner it runs Python.\
You can create a JSON file and put the absolute path of the project in it
